# Typing Speed Test App
This is a simple typing speed test app built with Python and Tkinter. The app displays a word for the user to type and then checks their input. It keeps track of their accuracy and how long it takes them to correctly type 10 words. Once they've typed 10 words correctly, the app will display their accuracy and elapsed time.
